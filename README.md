# Portfolio
Portfolio Project
Business Understanding:
Through the information I have learned from Cisco Network Academy, I have learned how to create a repository and create a portfolio that I can then host on Github. I have used Github before for various coding projects that I have worked on so its very interesting to be using this from a project and communicative business practice as an online project resume.
